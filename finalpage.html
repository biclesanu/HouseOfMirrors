However, the roots of your old habits are well anchored. You feel stuck, caught, as if the pain you've endured in order to get here is meaningless. From here on now, the process is slower, but the insight is worthwhile.       </div>

At times, you get a brief glimpse into this mirror, and you feel a sense of where things might be or should be headed. It shows you your true potential, or just something to aspire towards.
