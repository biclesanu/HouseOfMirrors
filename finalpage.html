        <div class = "caption"><p>Stripped down of worldly worries, you are nothing but what you feel. You question everything you've learned about the world and you lay the ground for a new set of values to settle in. The illusion of a revelation... It feels serene but it's temporary.</p></div>
        <div class = "caption"><p>This is the mirror that teaches self compassion.</p></div>

        <div class = "caption"><p>After processing so many things about your old self and learning these harsh new lessons, you expect a new life to unfold. However, the roots of your old habits are well anchored. You feel stuck, caught, as if the pain you've endured in order to get here is meaningless. From here on now, the process is slower, but the insight is worthwhile.</p></div>

        <div class = "caption"><p>The path to discovering the self is paved with a lot of trauma processing, a painful experience in which you sit with your internalized fears and pain. This is one of the hardest parts of the journey, and the benefits are to come much later. For now, you sit with some painful realizations.</p></div>

        <div class = "caption"><p>The final mirror, completely different from the others. At times, you get a brief glimpse into this mirror, and you feel a sense of where things might be or should be headed. It shows you your true potential, or just something to aspire towards. It's a replacement for the first mirror, showing you it's time to move towards something new.</p></div>
